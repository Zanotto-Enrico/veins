# Veins 3D
Veins 3D is an extension of the Veins framework for three-dimensional simulation scenarios including the support of 3D antenna patterns as well as several models covering the influence of a three-dimensional environment.

## Usage
Veins 3D is based on Veins 4.7.1, but also incorporates a few changes from Veins 5 to allow the usage of more recent SUMO versions.

The current version of Veins 3D has been tested with OMNeT++ 5.2 and SUMO 1.8.0.
For necessary adaptations in SUMO 1.8.0, have a look at the provided patch file *sumo-1.8.0-3Dchanges.patch*.
